Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Daisy. Daisy was five years old and loved to explore the world around her. One day, Daisy was walking in the park with her mom and dad and she saw a big, beautiful butterfly. Daisy was so excited that she wanted to catch it!

So, Daisy ran after the butterfly, but it was too fast for her. She tried and tried, but she just couldn't catch it. Just then, Daisy's mom saw a big tree with lots of colorful leaves. She told Daisy that if she climbed up the tree, she could get a better view of the butterfly and maybe even catch it.

So, Daisy climbed up the tree and soon she was high enough to see the butterfly. She watched it flutter around and then, just when she was about to grab it, the butterfly flew away. Daisy was a bit disappointed, but she still had a great time.

The next day, Daisy went back to the park and this time she brought a net with her. She waited patiently for the butterfly to come back and when it did, Daisy was ready. She slowly crept up to the butterfly and then, just when she was about to grab it, the butterfly flew away again!

Daisy was a bit frustrated, but she kept trying. Finally, after a few more tries, Daisy was able to catch the beautiful butterfly. She was so happy that she ran back to her mom and dad to show them. They were so proud of her for never giving up!

From then on, Daisy was always ready to explore and try new things. She never gave up and was always ready for a new adventure.
